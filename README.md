# Draggable Feature with Vue.js üöÄ

This project implements a smooth and flexible **draggable feature** using **Vue.js**, designed to enhance user experience by allowing intuitive interaction with elements on the page. After working on this for the past two days, we‚Äôve built a solution that is clean, efficient, and fully customizable!

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Add & Delete Items**: Dynamically add new items or remove existing ones from the list with just a click.
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to move items within the list seamlessly.
- **Swap Items**: Select and swap items with a simple click, for precise item swapping.
- **Index-Based Swapping**: Swap items based on user-defined index positions, allowing for precise control over item placement.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes and avoids horizontal scrolling, keeping the UI clean and functional.

## Technologies Used üîß

- **Vue.js**: Core framework for creating reactive and reusable components.
- **Vue Draggable**: Used to implement the drag-and-drop functionality with ease and flexibility.
- **Element Plus**: UI library for component styling and future enhancements (like dropdowns).

## Future Improvements üõ†Ô∏è

- **Multi-Item Selection**: Drag multiple items at once and rearrange them as needed, enhancing user flexibility.
